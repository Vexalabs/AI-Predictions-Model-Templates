### Fire Up Your Model with Docker!
Time to unleash your model! In your *same* terminal, run these commands:

1. **Change directory into the sports template:** `cd Stocks` 
1. **Build the magic image:** `docker build -t stocks-predictor .`
2. **Run your new image:** `docker run -p 8000:8000 stocks-predictor`

*Keep this terminal running! It's busy making predictions!*

### Is It Working? Let's Find Out!

Open your favorite web browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/health`

If all is well, you'll see a happy message like this:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "model_loaded": true,
  "last_trained_at": "2025-07-25 09:33:58"
}
```

You can also see the docs at: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

Now, let's make some predictions!

1.  In Visual Studio Code, go to the top right of your terminal, click the `+` dropdown, and select `Git Bash`. This will open a *second* terminal.
2.  In this new terminal, paste and run the following command:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{
             "name": "aapl",
             "date": "2025-04-10",
             "current_price": 202.38
           }'
    ```

    Get ready for your first prediction! How exciting is that?!

The response should be formatted as follows.

```json
{
  "4_hours": {
    "price_prediction": 281.00,
    "price_up_down": "up",
    "percentage_change": 1.67
  },
  "24_hours": {
    "price_prediction": 282.43,
    "price_up_down": "up",
    "percentage_change": 3.33
  },
  "2_days": {
    "price_prediction": 280.97,
    "price_up_down": "down",
    "percentage_change": -0.86
  },
  "7_days": {
    "price_prediction": 284.0,
    "price_up_down": "up",
    "percentage_change": 6.93
  }
}

```

### Craft Your Own Prediction Masterpiece!

This is where the real fun begins! You get to customize how your model thinks.

* Open `src/models.py`. This is your canvas! Update the logic in the predict method to reflect your brilliant prediction strategy.

Made changes? Awesome! Here's how to see them in action:

1.  Go back to your *first* terminal (where the model is running) and press `Ctrl + c` to stop it.
2.  Simply repeat the "Fire Up" and "Is It Working" steps above. Easy peasy!

**Congratulations, you are now a bona fide model builder!**

### Peek Under the Hood: Project Files Explained

Curious about what makes the Sports model tick? Here's a quick tour:

* **`main.py`**: This is the heart of your project, the starting point for your API and where your model gets called.
* **`src/api.py`**: Defines how your model talks to the world (the API structure).
* **`src/models.py`**: **This is where YOUR custom prediction logic lives!** Get creative here.
* **`src/schemas.py`**: Lays out the data structures the API expects and provides.

And the rest:

* **`.dockerignore`**: Tells Docker what files to skip. You probably won't need to touch this often.
* **`.gitignore`**: Tells Git what files to ignore. No need to edit unless you add new files you don't want tracked.
* **`LICENSE`**: The project's license.
* **`README.md`**: What you're reading right now!
* **`requirements.txt`**: Lets Docker know which Python libraries your project needs. **Important! If you add new Python libraries to your custom logic, remember to add them here!**
